# User Stories

Based on the initial stakeholder conversation, the following user stories have been identified for the Country/Currency Microservice:

1.  **As an application developer, I want to retrieve a list of countries, their ISO 3166 codes, and associated currencies via an API, so that my application uses consistent and standardized information.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   An API endpoint exists (e.g., `/countries`).
        *   The endpoint returns a JSON list of objects.
        *   Each object contains the country name, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, and a list of associated currency codes (ISO 4217).
        *   The data format is clearly documented.

2.  **As an application developer, I want the country and currency data provided by the microservice to be accurate and up-to-date, so that my application reflects the latest information without requiring manual updates by my team.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   The microservice uses a reliable external data source for country and currency information.
        *   A mechanism is in place to automatically update the data periodically (e.g., daily, weekly).
        *   Changes in geopolitical boundaries or currency usage are reflected within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., within 24 hours of the source update).

3.  **As an application developer, I want the country/currency microservice to be highly available, so that my application can reliably access the data it needs without interruption.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   The service is deployed in a redundant configuration (e.g., multiple instances, availability zones).
        *   Monitoring and alerting are set up to detect and notify of downtime.
        *   Target availability is defined (e.g., 99.9%).

4.  **As an application developer, I want the country/currency microservice API to respond quickly, so that my application remains performant and provides a smooth user experience.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   API response times for the primary endpoint (e.g., `/countries`) are consistently low (e.g., p95 < 200ms under typical load).
        *   Performance is monitored.
        *   Caching strategies are implemented where appropriate.

5.  **As a system architect, I want the microservice to be designed for easy expansion, so that we can add new data fields or related information in the future with minimal effort.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   The codebase follows standard design patterns (e.g., layered architecture).
        *   The data model is flexible or easily modifiable.
        *   Adding new data fields (e.g., country capital, population) requires minimal changes to the core service logic.
        *   Code is well-documented.

6.  **As a development team lead, I want my team to consume country/currency data from a centralized microservice, so that we avoid the overhead and potential errors of managing this data manually within our application.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   The microservice is successfully deployed and accessible within the organization's network.
        *   Clear documentation is available for developers on how to integrate with the API.
        *   Teams currently managing this data manually are informed and encouraged to switch to the microservice.
