**Stakeholder:** Hi, thanks for meeting with me today. We've got a challenge related to keeping our country and currency data accurate and up to date across our apps. 
Currently, every team manually manages these lists, and it's causing inconsistencies and extra overhead.

**Project Manager:** That sounds cumbersome. Could you describe exactly what's needed to improve this?

**Stakeholder:** Sure. What we need is a simple, centralized microservice. It should provide a constantly updated list of countries, their ISO 3166 codes, and the relevant 
currencies.

**Project Manager:** Understood. So, you'd like a single source of truth that ensures everyone pulls from the same, reliable dataset?

**Stakeholder:** Exactly. Right now, every time there's a geopolitical change or currency update, multiple teams scramble to update their own data separately. This often 
leads to errors and delays.

**Project Manager:** Got it. How frequently does this information typically change?

**Stakeholder:** Not too often, but when it does, it's crucial that all our services reflect those updates promptly. Ideally, we wouldn't have to worry about manual updates 
at all.

**Project Manager:** So, automation and accuracy are key here. Would the teams need additional information besides countries, ISO codes, and currencies?

**Stakeholder:** At the moment, no. But it would be good if the microservice was built in a way that we could expand it easily if needed.

**Project Manager:** Makes sense. One more thingâ€”how critical is performance? Should we optimize for speed, availability, or both?

**Stakeholder:** Definitely both. Availability is essential because downtime would affect multiple applications, and speed ensures user experience stays smooth.

**Project Manager:** Understood clearly. We'll focus on building something reliable, fast, and easy to maintain.

**Stakeholder:** Perfect. Let me know if you need anything else to get started.
